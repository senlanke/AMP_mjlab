# AMP_mjlab

[中文 README](README_zh.md)

Deployment integration code is in [ccrpRepo/wbc_fsm](https://github.com/ccrpRepo/wbc_fsm), under `MJAmp State`.

G1 AMP motion control project built on top of mjlab + rsl_rl.

Key features of this repository:

- A single policy learns both locomotion (walk/run) and recovery (fall-and-get-up)
- AMP discriminator regularizes motion style and priors
- Training and deployment pipelines are consistent, with direct ONNX policy export support

## Core Idea

Instead of training separate policies for locomotion and recovery and switching between them, this project learns both capabilities in one unified policy.

Implementation highlights:

- Motion data split:
  - Walk/Run data: `src/assets/motions/g1/amp/WalkandRun`
  - Recovery data: `src/assets/motions/g1/amp/Recovery`
- Delayed termination/reset:
  - A subset of environments does not reset immediately after termination
  - These environments receive a recovery window and reset states sampled from recovery clips
- Unified AMP training:
  - One actor-critic + One AMP discriminator
  - Velocity tracking, perturbation robustness, and recovery are learned together

This reduces discontinuities caused by policy switching and yields more consistent behavior.

## Installation Guide

### System Requirements

- Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04 is recommended
- GPU: NVIDIA GPU
- Driver version: 550 or later is recommended
- Python: 3.11

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to run training and deployment programs in a virtual environment. Conda is recommended for environment management. If Conda is already installed, skip step 1.1.

#### 1.1 Download and Install Miniconda

```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

Initialize Conda:

```bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init --all
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 1.2 Create a New Environment

```bash
conda create -n mjlab python=3.11
```

#### 1.3 Activate the Environment

```bash
conda activate mjlab
```

### 2. Install the Project

#### 2.1 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccrpRepo/AMP_mjlab.git
cd AMP_mjlab
```

#### 2.2 Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install -y libyaml-cpp-dev libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libspdlog-dev libfmt-dev
```

#### 2.3 Install Python Dependencies

All Python dependencies are specified in `setup.py`. Install the project from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

### 3. Apply mjlab Patch

The default configuration uses `history_ordering="time"`. Apply this patch unless you remove the `history_ordering` configuration from the code.

What this patch does:

- It adds an option for how observation history is flattened: by time (`time`) or by term (`term`).
- Default mjlab behavior supports only `term` ordering.

Patch file:

- `mjlab_patch/mjlab/managers/observation_manager.py`

Patch command:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
import shutil
import mjlab.managers.observation_manager as observation_manager

src = Path("mjlab_patch/mjlab/managers/observation_manager.py").resolve()
dst = Path(observation_manager.__file__).resolve()
backup = dst.with_suffix(dst.suffix + ".bak")

if not backup.exists():
    shutil.copy2(dst, backup)
shutil.copy2(src, dst)
print(f"Patched mjlab observation manager: {dst}")
PY
```

### 4. List Available Tasks

```bash
python scripts/list_envs.py --keyword AMP
```

Main tasks:

- `Unitree-G1-AMP-Rough`
- `Unitree-G1-AMP-Flat`

## Training

```bash
python scripts/train.py Unitree-G1-AMP-Flat --env.scene.num-envs=4096
```

Logs are saved by default to:

- `logs/rsl_rl/g1_amp_locomotion/<time_stamp_run>/`

## Training Curve Note (Important)

- Around `2w` iterations (about 20k), the policy often suddenly learns fall-recovery behavior.
- As a result, multiple metrics in `logs` may show abrupt jumps. This is expected and not necessarily a training failure.

## Evaluation and Visualization

Replay with a trained checkpoint:

```bash
python scripts/play.py Unitree-G1-AMP-Rough \
  --checkpoint-file logs/rsl_rl/g1_amp_locomotion/<run_dir>/model_<iter>.pt
```

Note: ONNX export is enabled by default in both training and play workflows.

## Motion Data Preparation

CSV-to-NPZ conversion script:

```bash
python scripts/csv_to_npz.py --help
```

Recommended data layout:

- Raw CSV: `motion_data_csv/amp`
- Converted NPZ: `src/assets/motions/g1/amp/WalkandRun` and `src/assets/motions/g1/amp/Recovery`

If valid NPZ files exist in these folders, training config loads them automatically.

## Repository Structure

- `src/tasks/amp_loco`: AMP locomotion/recovery task implementation
- `src/tasks/amp_loco/config/g1`: G1 task registration, env configs, RL configs
- `src/tasks/amp_loco/mdp`: rewards, observations, events, termination logic
- `scripts/train.py`: training entry point
- `scripts/play.py`: playback entry point
- `scripts/csv_to_npz.py`: motion data conversion tool
- `mjlab_patch`: required local patch for mjlab

## Highlights

- One policy unifies walk/run and recovery skills
- AMP + velocity objective jointly optimize style and task performance
- Delayed reset with recovery sampling explicitly improves recovery ability
- End-to-end pipeline supports ONNX export for deployment
